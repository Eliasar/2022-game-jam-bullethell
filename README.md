# Traxx

Ride the rails in this constrained adventure as you shoot drones out of the sky. They're attacking your train, and frankly, we don't know why! Fire your weapons with left click, move along the rail with W and S, and shield yourself from danger by using the shield on your back.

There's no sound, sorry! Didn't get to it during the time limit.

Available for Windows PC.
